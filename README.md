# Housing Price Predictions
Here is an implementation of a basic Linear Regression model that predicts housing prices given a dataset containing information about housing prices in California. This Dataset can be found under the 'sample_data' folder on Google Colab where this model was trained and tested. 
A Linear Regression algorithm works by finding a best fitted line by assuming a linear relationship between one or more input features and a scalar output. Linear Regression is best used to predict continuous valued outputs.
